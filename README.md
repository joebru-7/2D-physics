# Space_Shooter
Made for assigmnent

* How the implementation makes efficient use of computer hardware
  
	It for example retains allocations and have contigius storage
  
* How the implementation uses a data-oriented method
  
	The bullets is put in a quad tree as to more effichently clauclate collisions
  
* How code was optimized by based on findings from using a profiler
  
  	I noticed collision was slow so added AABB checks and it made it 3% faster. see tags
